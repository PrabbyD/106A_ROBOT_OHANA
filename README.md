# 106A_ROBOT_OHANA
The final project for the ROBOT OHANA group for FA20 106a. The project is an AR simulation of multi-robot communication. The simulation is intended to initially feature simple turtlebots in an AR environment, using the camera as a sensor and some pathfinding algorithms to traverse the environment from a start to end goal. This project utilizes Unity for the AR simulation using their ARFoundation package, ROS for robot and message communication, and AWS for server hosting.
